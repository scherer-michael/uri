# uri
URI library to parse a URI-shapped string to an object that can be checked for compliance ((RFC 1738, RFC 3986).C

[Work in progress]

## Todo :
- Error and exceptions system
- Few optimizations
- Build system (CMake)


Disclaimer :  
This "library" (piece of code, more like it...) exists mostly because other library did not suit my use cases (yep, the old Yet Another Library...). Few lines and functions have been inspired from other libraries (they were simple, efficient and "Why reinvent the wheel if it already exists ?"). This code is here as is, mainly as a backup for me to not loose such useful utility lib.  
So : fork it, use it, change it, but remember : this code comes from the world wide community of software developers.
